## ✅ Full Checklist: How to Learn and What to Do to Get There

### 1. 🧱 Core Programming Fundamentals

- [ ] Learn how to declare variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- [ ] Understand data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined
- [ ] Practice writing `if-else` and `switch` statements
- [ ] Use comparison operators (`===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, etc.)
- [ ] Use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- [ ] Write `for`, `while`, and `for...of` loops
- [ ] Understand loop control: `break`, `continue`

### 2. 🧠 Functions & Scope

- [ ] Write basic functions with one argument
- [ ] Write functions with multiple arguments
- [ ] Return values from functions
- [ ] Understand function expressions and arrow functions
- [ ] Learn about scope: global vs. local
- [ ] Understand closures and lexical scope

### 3. 📦 Data Structures

- [ ] Create and manipulate arrays
- [ ] Use array methods: `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.shift()`, `.unshift()`
- [ ] Use higher-order array methods: `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.find()`
- [ ] Create and access objects
- [ ] Loop through objects with `for...in`
- [ ] Nest arrays and objects and access deeply nested data

### 4. 🔄 Asynchronous JavaScript

- [ ] Understand what asynchronous code is
- [ ] Learn how to use `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`
- [ ] Work with Promises: `.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`
- [ ] Use `async` and `await` syntax
- [ ] Handle errors in async code

### 5. 🖱️ DOM Manipulation

- [ ] Select elements with `document.querySelector()` and `getElementById()`
- [ ] Change text and HTML content
- [ ] Modify styles and classes
- [ ] Create and remove elements dynamically
- [ ] Handle events: `click`, `input`, `submit`, etc.
- [ ] Prevent default behavior with `event.preventDefault()`

### 6. 🧪 Practice Projects

- [ ] Build a button that changes a div’s color
- [ ] Create a form that captures user input
- [ ] Validate form fields before submission
- [ ] Display a message after form submission
- [ ] Build a simple to-do list
- [ ] Create a quiz app with score tracking
- [ ] Use input fields to manipulate strings (e.g., capitalization)

### 7. 🌐 Working with APIs

- [ ] Understand what an API is
- [ ] Use `fetch()` to get data from an API
- [ ] Handle JSON responses
- [ ] Display API data on the page
- [ ] Simulate form submission to a fake API
- [ ] Clear form and show success message after submission

### How to use this checklist

- Work top to bottom; check off each box only after you’ve practiced it in code.
- For every concept, write a tiny demo (10–30 lines) and a one‑sentence summary of what it does.
- Build the practice projects as soon as you finish Sections 1–5; then iterate.
- When you reach APIs (Section 7), wire one small feature end‑to‑end: UI → fetch → render → error state.

### Minimal “starter loop” for practice

1. Pick a small goal (e.g., “filter a list and render it”).
2. Write it in plain JS (no framework) in a single HTML file.
3. Explain it in comments; then remove the comments and refactor.
4. Repeat until it feels easy; then rebuild the same idea with a framework.

Happy building.
