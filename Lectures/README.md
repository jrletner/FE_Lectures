## JS Essentials for independent developers (no‑AI)

- These are the things you need to know, without AI assistance, if you really want to be a skilled developer.

### What to study (at a glance)

- Core programming fundamentals (variables, types, conditionals, loops)
- Functions & scope (arrow functions, defaults, closures)
- Data structures (arrays/objects, map/filter/reduce/find, nested access)
- Asynchronous JS (setTimeout/Interval, Promises, async/await, errors)
- DOM manipulation (select/update, events, create/remove, delegation)
- Practice projects (small, complete UI exercises)
- Working with APIs (fetch, JSON, loading/error states, pagination)
- Environment setup (editor, DevTools, Node/npm, Git, lint/format, debugger)
- Internalize concepts (teach‑back, rebuild from memory, journal)

### Use these two docs in this folder

- JS Essentials (No‑AI Study Checklist) — nine sections with checkboxes and brief guidance.
  - Link: [JS Essentials.md](./JS%20Essentials.md)
- JS Essentials Workbook — ~6 hands‑on exercises per section with Goal, Steps, and Success criteria.
  - Link: [JS Essentials Workbook.md](./JS%20Essentials%20Workbook.md)

### How to work through them

1. Read one checklist section; immediately build a tiny demo (10–30 lines).
2. Do 2–3 matching workbook exercises to lock it in.
3. Repeat weekly: revisit any fuzzy areas with one new demo and one exercise.

### Suggested first pass

1. Core fundamentals → Functions & scope → Data structures → Asynchronous JS
2. Do the Workbook exercises for those four sections
3. Then Working with APIs + DOM manipulation (wire UI ↔ API)
4. Keep Environment setup and Internalize concepts as ongoing habits

### Bring it into Node/Express quickly

- Use map/filter/reduce/find inside route handlers
- Validate inputs; sanitize objects before responding
- Use async/await for DB/HTTP calls; handle errors clearly
- Support pagination and basic sorting in list endpoints

Keep examples tiny, readable, and runnable. If something feels fuzzy, revisit the checklist and grab 1–2 workbook exercises until it clicks.
