# FE Lectures

This repo is organized for our course. It contains the live lecture code.

- `Lectures/` — Code typed during each lecture (dated folders).
- `Resources/` — Supporting docs and tools for the course:
  - JavaScript Video Tutorial Link
  - `VSCode_Extensions.md` — Recommended VS Code extensions.

## Resources

- JavaScript Tutorial Video Link
- VS Code extensions: `Resources/VSCode_Extensions.md`
  - What’s inside: A short, curated list of editor extensions we’ll use in class (formatting, HTML/JS helpers, Live Server, dotenv, and optional framework snippets like Svelte/React).
  - How to use: Open the file, install items you don’t have from the VS Code Marketplace. Prettier + Live Server are the key ones for this repo.
